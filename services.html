     <h1>In 2010, Thai Airways marked its 50th anniversary by initiating a fleet renewal plan under President Piyasvasti Amranand, ordering Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s, and refurbishing Boeing 747 and 777 cabins. To cut fuel costs, it retired inefficient aircraft like the Airbus A340-500 and received its first A380 in 2012 for European routes. Thai expanded its network, adding routes to Brussels and Phuket, while suspending Athens due to the Greek debt crisis.

Thai launched Asia’s first biofuel-powered commercial flights in 2011 under its “Travel Green” initiative, aiming to promote sustainable aviation fuel in Thailand. In 2015, Thailand was downgraded to Category 2 by both ICAO and the FAA due to aviation safety oversight deficiencies, barring Thai Airways from expanding U.S. routes. The EU, however, granted continued access through TCO certification.

Thai ended its U.S. service in October 2015 and briefly launched a Tehran route in 2016, which ended in 2018. Plans to return to the U.S. were abandoned due to prior losses, though cities like San Francisco and Seattle were considered. Thai Smile explored new regional routes during this time.

In 2016, Thai improved its route management system, optimizing connections via Bangkok. Routes to Japan, Australia, and India were adjusted, and new flights to Perth and Brisbane were announced. Despite efforts, Thai reported a 6.8 billion baht loss in the first half of 2019 and was audited by the State Audit Office.</h1>
