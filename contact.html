    <p1>on 16 June 2025, the Central Bankruptcy Court granted permission for Thai Airways to exit its rehabilitation program, as the airline had achieved the four conditions required by the plan: formation of a new board, EBITDA of ฿40,000 million (double the benchmark set), disciplined repayments without default, and a registered capital increase with debt-to-equity conversion. 
      The airline later resumed trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand on 4 August 2025, with an opening price of ฿10.5 per share, representing a 134.4% increase from the capital increase offering price of ฿4.48 per share, and a market capitalization of nearly ฿300,000 million. 
      During an interview with the Bangkok Post on 24 August 2025, Chai Eamsiri, Chief Executive Officer of Thai Airways, revealed that the airline plans to double the frequencies of its flights to Guangzhou and Beijing, increasing from seven to fourteen per week for each destination. 
      Thai Airways will also resume services to Xiamen, Chongqing, and Changsha, each with seven weekly flights, and will introduce new routes to Wuhan and Shenzhen. In addition, the airline is considering launching a new route to Gaya, along with several new domestic routes, in line with the delivery of new aircraft. 
      To bridge the capacity gap before these aircraft arrive, Thai Airways plans to lease eight to ten wide-body aircraft for a period of six years, with a final decision expected in September 2025. 
      The airline will also commence a cabin refurbishment program across its Airbus A320, Airbus A350-900, and Boeing 777-300ER fleets.</p1>
